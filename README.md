**Project Overview**
MAX PARK is a smart parking optimization system developed as part of a final project for the Industrial Engineering and Management degree with a focus on Information Systems. The system addresses the challenge of efficiently managing organizational parking spaces, saving resources by allocating them optimally based on a set of algorithms that match users to available spaces.

The project's core functionality centers around an intelligent algorithm that considers multiple reservation factors, including consecutive bookings, to assign parking spots in a way that maximizes available space and minimizes conflicts between users. This feature provides organizations with a robust solution for parking resource management, enabling better space utilization and enhanced user satisfaction.

**Key Features**
1. Optimized Space Management: The system efficiently manages and allocates parking spots to reduce congestion and resource wastage.
2. Smart Algorithm: The algorithm handles consecutive bookings and prioritizes space efficiency, allowing multiple users to share parking spaces seamlessly.
3. Automated Scheduling: A web-based cron job schedules the smart algorithm to run daily at 20:00, ensuring consistent and timely parking allocation optimization.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The application provides an easy-to-use interface for making, viewing, and managing parking reservations.
